            <p>
            Our story begins with Sir Andrew Caldecott, the then British Governor of Ceylon, 
            who declared open the doors of the first state-owned commercial bank 
            on August 1, 1939, in Fort, Colombo
            </p>

            <p>
            Since our inception, we have consistently engaged with Sri Lankans from all walks of life 
            in a committed effort to create value for all stakeholders, with the objective of 
            being the “preferred financial partner” for our customers.
            With the largest network of touchpoints across the island, 
            leveraged on a backbone of future-ready technologies, 
            we strive to provide maximum convenience in access to financial services 
            to our customers.
            </p>

            <p>
            In creating greater value BOC established its international footprint 
            with the establishment of overseas branches in key locations. 
            Namely: London, UK, Male and Hulhumalé in the Maldives, Chennai, India, and the Seychelles, 
            that are a part of Sri Lanka’s largest global network of overseas correspondent banks and exchange companies
            </p>

            <p>
            As Sri Lanka’s premier financial services organisation with over eight decades of leadership 
            in opening up a world of opportunity for our stakeholders and the nation, 
            we are delighted to be the No. 1 bank in Sri Lanka that drives growth and prosperity for 
            all citizens
